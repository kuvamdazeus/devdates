## DevDates ♥️

Dating app for my fellow developers 😉

### Why make this app?

> Why not?

### Why not tinder?

> For it to work, you need to pay. OR lemme rephrase that, you pay to get girls. Doesn't sounds right, huh!

### How can I contribute towards eveybody getting girls/bois?

> Just make a PR containing the **WHAT**, **WHY** & **HOW**. SIMPLE!

.env file:

```python
NEXT_PUBLIC_GH_OAUTH_ID = 'github oauth client id'

DATABASE_URL = 'mysql://root:admin@localhost:3306/dates'

JWT_SECRET = 'json web token secret goes here, or maybe make this your secret!'
```
